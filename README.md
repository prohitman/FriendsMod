**FriendsMod** is a horror-flavored Minecraft mod commissioned by **Monsoon**, built on top of the **Voice Chat Mod** library integrated via **OpenAL**. It introduces the **Mimic**, a haunting doppelgänger that mimics the actions and voices of targetted players.

## 🌸 Mimic Flower…

Scattered across the world, you'll find patches of **Mimic Flowers**.

- Touching one causes slight damage.
- It **stores the NBT data of the player** — the name, skin, and general appearance.
- After maturing, the flower bursts open and the **Mimic spawns**.

## 🧬 The Mimic Mob

Once spawned, the **Mimic** takes on a distorted version the payer appearance.

| Trait | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Appearance** | Almost exactly like the player it mimics, including a garbled name tag. |
| **Body Deformities** | Slightly longer/shorter limbs and subtle color tint. |
| **Movement** | Can walk, explore, and even **place blocks** like a player. |

## 🎤 Voice Imitation (Powered by Voice Chat Mod)

The Mimic uses the **Voice Chat Mod** API to listen to incoming voice inputs.  
When a player **speaks within range**, the Mimic records a short snippet.

- It will **repeat the speech back**, periodically and with slight pitch shifts.
- Over time, it builds a bank of vocal fragments.
